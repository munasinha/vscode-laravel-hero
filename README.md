## Why Laravel Hero?

**Imagine managing your entire Laravel application without ever leaving VS Code.** No terminal juggling. No memorizing artisan commands. Just pure, visual productivity.

Laravel Hero transforms VS Code into a complete Laravel control center. Think of it as your car's dashboard everything you need is right there, beautifully organized, one click away.

---

## 🚀 What Makes This Different?

This isn't another syntax highlighter or snippet pack. **Laravel Hero is a full featured Laravel management interface** built directly into VS Code. 

It's like having a powerful admin panel for your Laravel application, but for developers.

</div>

**Your Laravel cockpit.** See the essentials before you touch a line of code.

- **Project snapshot** project name, environment, Laravel and PHP versions
- **Connection health** database driver + live connection check, cache driver status
- **One click maintenance** run config cache, config clear, optimize, cache clear, route clear, and view clear right from VS Code
- **VS Code native** same styling, buttons, and alerts as every other panel

*Real world scenario:* You open a legacy project and need to confirm it's wired correctly. One glance shows PHP version, Laravel version, DB connection health, and cache driver. Two clicks cache and config refresh, no terminal hopping.

### 🗄️ **Database Migrations - Visual & Effortless**

**See every migration at a glance.** Green check marks show what's migrated, circles show what's pending. Like a project management board, but for your database.

- **Create migrations** with a simple dialog no `php artisan` needed
- **Run individual migrations** or execute all pending ones in sequence
- **Rollback with precision** specify exact steps or rollback everything
- **Force re run** for development without touching your terminal
- **Search and sort** through hundreds of migrations instantly
- **Jump to source** with one click

*Real world scenario:* You're onboarding a new developer. Instead of sending them a list of terminal commands, they open Laravel Hero, see exactly what migrations need to run, and click "Run All." Done in 3 seconds.

### 🌐 **Routes - Your Application's Road Map**

<div align="center" style="margin:30px 0;">

- **Smart search** across everything—find that one protected route instantly
- **Copy URLs** to clipboard for quick API testing
- **Middleware insights** see compact chips, click to expand full namespaces
- **Export to CSV** for documentation or client reviews

<div align="center" style="margin:30px 0;">
  <img style="width:100%" src="media/overview/laravel-hero-model-relationship-graph.png">
</div>

**Visualize your entire data architecture.** Like an architect's blueprint, but for your database relationships.

- **ER style diagrams** - showing all models and their connections
- **Relationship labels** - one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, polymorphic
- **Interactive canvas** - drag, zoom, pan with collision free layouts
- **Smart positioning** - most connected models centered automatically
- **Double click to open** - jump directly to model files
- **Intelligent search** - find models and highlight their relationships
- **Direction indicators** - see which side is "one" vs "many"

*Real world scenario:* New team member asks "How do Users relate to Posts and Comments?" You open the graph, zoom to User, and they see the entire relationship chain visually. Explanation done without saying a word.
